How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	Because I could see differences between the two versions and I only had to review the differences, not the whole source code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	I can find bugs easier and can do rollbacks if needed to go to the last correct version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Pro: better control and reduce the number of changes to the right level.
	Con: I could forget a commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	git treats a program with many files as a whole.
	Google docs treats the one doc as a single component.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	with git log I can see the commit history and with dit diff I can find the differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	I don;t have to be afraid to have issues rolling back any changes
